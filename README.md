## Skills

#### Process Management


In any project in my career and throughout my learning, I am proactive in introducing processes and procedures to better faciliate teamwork, visibility and task management within teams and across business functions. As a result, everyone in my teams has a clear idea of the state of a project and what is needed from eachother, and anyone with oversight of me or my team to easily review progress and understand where they are required. 

I set the strategic direction for every project I was on, breaking down our requirements and functions into step my step instructions that could form individual tickets for a sprint, and created templates for user stories and tickets that could easily be replicated by team. This helped streamline the process for our projects and ensured that members of my teams who were less confident of how to work towards our final goals could clearly see what neeeded to be done and select tickets that helped build their confidence.

#### Teamwork
